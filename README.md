<h1>Flixbus Prices Analyzer</h1>

This Python script uses the Selenium framework to scrape FlixBus website (https://www.flixbus.pl/) for bus route information between two cities. It allows you to specify the city of departure, the city of destination, and how many days in advance you want to search for bus routes. The script collects data for multiple days and saves it in a CSV file.
